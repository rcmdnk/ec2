# ec2

AWS CLI Wrapper for EC2 management.

## Requirement

- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

## Installation

Use Homebrew:

```
$ brew install rcmdnk/rcmdnkpac/ec2
```

If you have not installed `awscli` by Homebrew, it is also installed.

Or put `bin/ec2` and `bin/ec2_submit` anywhere in the PATH.
(In this case, you need to install `awscli` by yourself.)

### AWS CLI Profile

If you want to use a profile other than the default,
use `--aws-profile`, set `aws_profile` in the configuration file or
set:

```
export AWS_PROFILE=xxx
```

before using ec2.

### Configuration

Use **~/.config/ec2/config**.

Options can be set like:

```
name_filter=my-instance
```

`#` can be used to comment out the line.

Available options are same as the command line options starting with `--`, but without `--` and `-` is replaced by `_`,
i.e., `aws_profile` for `--aws-profile`.

### Examples

#### Manage my instances with the prefix "my-instances"

Make ~/.config/ec2/config file as follows:

```
name_filter=my-instances
ssh_key=~/.ssh/my_ssh.pem
ssh_user=ec2-user
aws_profile=my-profile
```

This will show only instances which include `my-instances` in the Name.

It uses the key **~/.ssh/my_ssh.pem** at `ec2 ssh` or `ec2 mosh`, with the user name `ec2-user`.

Set `aws_profile` if you want to use other than the default profile.

#### Launch new instance

```
$ ec2 -t r3.large launch
```

If you give `-t select`, you can choose the instance type from the list.

You can pass the template name by `-T <your template>`, too.

#### Create a new template version

First, make a new AMI from an existing instance:

```
$ ec2 new_image
```

Then, make new template version:

```
$ ec2 new_template
```

During the command, select the template name that you want to update
and select a new AMI created above.

If old AMI is not necessary, remove it:

```
$ ec2 rm_image
```

This command also removes the associated snapshot.

Note: `new_image` create a new version of the template. If you do not have any templates,
make it with the Web interface or aws cli command directly.

### Development

#### pre-commit

Install pre-commit by pip:

```
$ pip3 install pre-commit
```

or by Homebrew

```
$ brew install pre-commit
```

Install pre-commit environment:

```
$ pre-commit install
```

Then, automatically checked at `git commit` or run checks manually:

```
$ pre-commit run -a
```
